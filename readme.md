# 🚚 ShipmentSure - AI-Powered Shipment Delay Prediction

## 📌 Overview

ShipmentSure is a Machine Learning-powered web application that predicts whether a shipment will be delivered on time or delayed based on logistics and customer-related factors.

The project was developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship 6.0** and demonstrates the complete Machine Learning lifecycle from data preprocessing to cloud deployment.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Delayed shipments can lead to:

* Customer dissatisfaction
* Increased operational costs
* Supply chain disruptions
* Reduced business trust

ShipmentSure helps organizations predict shipment delays in advance, enabling proactive decision-making and improved logistics planning.
